## General Rules

1.- Googling for answers is possible but copy/pasting a solution is not.

2. All questions are allowed, and even encouraged. As interviwers we can decide not to answer a question if we are evaluating on that topic, but thatÂ´s for us to decide! Ask away!
3. Code, folders and styling structure must be clean, mantainable and scalable.
4. Styling will be considered, so apply the styles you consider necessary. To avoid extra complexity implement the styles alongside the components.

Note: This exercise uses React Native for Web components. If any doubt please check the docs: https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/

  using this public API: https://restcountries.com/
